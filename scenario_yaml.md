# Test Scenario format description
Test scenarios for Akropolis pool testing are contructed in YAML format.
Here is the description of available commands and their parameters.
Scenarios are consctructed from commands, which are executed in the same order as they are writen in the scenario file.

## Available commands

### Configuration and reports

#### groups
Create named groups of users (addresses), which can be referenced in other commands.
Addresses in tests are generated by [HDWalletProvider](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-hdwallet-provider).
A group should list indexes of address to be assigned to this group.
```yaml
groups:
    group1: [10,11,12,13,14,15]
    group2: [20,21,22,23,24,25]
```

#### report-type
Define types of the reports: which information `report` command has to store.
For this command one should specify contracts and their methods with arguments to call.
Results of the call will be stored in a log.
```yaml
report-type:
    name: myReportType
    contracts:
        - Contract1:
          - method1: [argument1, argument2]
          - method2: [argument1, argument2]
```

#### report
Stores current state of the contract(s) defined in `report-type` in a log file.
```yaml
report: myReportType
``` 

### Actions

#### deposit
For each user in the `group` deposit `amount` DAI to the pool, waiting for `sleep` seconds after each user.
```yaml
deposit:
    group: group1 
    amount: 100
    sleep: 10
```
