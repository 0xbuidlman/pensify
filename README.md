AkropolisOS - Ethereum implementation (active development)
AkropolisOS is a DAO framework where members of which can earn high-interest rates by providing undercollateralized loans to other members and by pooling and investing capital through various liquid DeFi instruments.

Description of Akropolis Pool can be found in our [wiki](https://wiki.akropolis.io/pool/).

## PTK Distributions
When borrower repays some part of his loan, he uses some PTK (either from his balance or minted when he sends DAI to the pool).
This PTKs are distributed to supporters, proportionally to the part of the loan they covered. The borrower himself also covered half of the loan, and his part is distributed over the whole pool.
All users of the pool receive part of this distributions proportional to the amount of PTK they hold on their balance and in loan proposals, PTK locked as collateral for loans is not counted.
![PTK Distributions](/docs/diagram_distributions.jpg)
### Distribution mechanics
When you need to distribute some amount of tokens over all token holders one's first straight-forward idea might be to iterate through all token holders, check their balance and increase it by their part of the distribution.
Unfortunately, this approach can hardly be used in Ethereum blockchain. All operations in EVM cost some gas. If we have a lot of token holders, gas cost for iteration through all may be higher than a gas limit for transaction (which is currently equal to gas limit for block).
Instead, during distribution we just store amount of PTK to be distributed and current amount of all PTK qualified for distribution. And user balance is only updated by separate request or when it is going to be changed by transfer, mint or burn. During this "lazy" update we go through all distributions occured between previous and current update.
Now, one may ask what if there is too much distributions occurred in the pool between this updated and the gas usage to iterate through all of them is too high again? Obvious solution would be to allow split such transaction to several smaller ones, and we've implemented this approach.
But we also decided to aggregate all distributions during a day. This way we can protect ourself from dust attacks, when somebody may do a lot of small repays which cause a lot of small distributions.
When a distribution request is received by PToken we check if it's time to actually create new distribution. If it's not, we just add distribution amount to the accumulator.
When time comes (and this condition is also checked by transfers, mints and burns), actual distribution is created using accumulated amount of PTK and total supply of qualified PTK.

## Defi module distributions
Defi module transfers funds to some underlying protocol, Compound in current version. Exchange rate of DAI to Compound DAI is icreased over time. So while amount of Compound DAI stays same, amount of underlying DAI available is continiously increased.
During distributions Defi module calculates this additional ammount, so that PTK holders can widhraw their share at any time.
![Compound Distributions](/docs/diagram_compound_distributions.jpg)
### Distribution mechanics
Defi module is configured to create distributions once a day. It stores time of next distribution and when time comes, any change of PTK balance or withdraw request will trigger a new distribution.
With this distribution event Defi module stores how many additional DAI it can distribute, current balances of DAI and PTK.
When one decides to withdraw (claim) his share of this additional DAI, Defi module iterates through all unclaimed distributions and calculates user's share of that distribution accroding to user's PTK balance and total amount of PTK at that time.
